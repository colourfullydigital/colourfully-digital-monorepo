# Project Brief: Colourfully Digital Foundation Website

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the project brief for the Colourfully Digital Foundation website. The project is a headless architecture using Sanity.io as a CMS, a statically-generated frontend built with Astro and React, and Netlify Forms with Make.com for form processing. The primary problem being solved is the need for a flexible, scalable, and maintainable platform to support the foundation's mission of providing accessible STEM education to its target market of students, volunteers, and donors.

## Problem Statement

The Colourfully Digital Foundation requires a modern, performant, and easy-to-manage web presence to effectively deliver on its mission. The current challenge is the absence of a centralized, scalable platform that can handle content management, community engagement (like volunteer applications and newsletter subscriptions), and program information dissemination. Without a proper platform, the foundation faces difficulties in reaching its audience, managing its content, and automating its workflows, which hinders its ability to grow and serve the community.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is a headless architecture that decouples the content management system from the frontend presentation layer. This approach leverages Sanity.io as a headless CMS for all content, a statically-generated frontend built with Astro for optimal performance with interactive React "islands" for dynamic components, and Netlify Forms integrated with Make.com for robust workflow automation. This modern stack will provide a high-performance, secure, and scalable website that is easy to maintain and update.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Aspiring STEM Students
- **Profile**: Students of all ages, particularly from underrepresented backgrounds, who are interested in learning more about STEM fields and participating in educational programs.
- **Needs**: Easy access to program information, clear registration processes, and engaging educational content.

### Secondary User Segment: Volunteers & Mentors
- **Profile**: Professionals and university students in STEM fields who are looking to contribute their time and expertise.
- **Needs**: A simple application process, clear information about volunteer roles and expectations, and resources to support their mentorship activities.

### Tertiary User Segment: Donors & Supporters
- **Profile**: Individuals and organizations interested in supporting the foundation's mission financially or through partnership.
- **Needs**: A transparent and easy way to donate, clear information about the foundation's impact, and updates on how their contributions are being used.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives

- **Increase Partnership Enrollment**: Onboard 3 new strategic partners to expand the foundation's reach and resources.
- **Grow Volunteer Base**: Increase the number of qualified volunteer applications by 40% in the first year.
- **Boost Newsletter Subscriptions**: Grow the newsletter subscriber list by 50% to improve community engagement.

### User Success Metrics

- **High Satisfaction**: Achieve a high user satisfaction score (e.g., >80% on post-interaction surveys) for form submission processes.
- **Reduced Bounce Rate**: Lower the website's overall bounce rate by 20%, indicating that users are finding the content relevant and engaging.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Volunteer Form Submissions**: Number of completed volunteer application forms per month.
- **Newsletter Sign-ups**: Number of new newsletter subscribers per month.
- **Page Load Time**: Maintain an average page load time of under 2 seconds.

## MVP Scope

The scope of the MVP is the currently documented system, which includes:

### Core Features (Must Have)

- **Headless CMS**: Sanity.io for all website content.
- **Static Frontend**: Astro and React-based website hosted on Netlify.
- **Volunteer Application Form**: A form for prospective volunteers to apply.
- **Newsletter Subscription Form**: A form for users to subscribe to the newsletter.
- **Form Processing**: Automation of form submissions using Netlify Forms and Make.com.

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Registration platform for events or programs.
  - User authentication and profiles.
- Volunteer management system.
- E-commerce functionality.
- Advanced search capabilities.

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

- **Target Platforms**: Modern web browsers on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Performance Requirements**: Fast page loads (< 2s) and high availability.

### Technology Preferences

- **Frontend**: Astro, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Netlify Functions (as needed), Make.com
- **CMS**: Sanity.io
- **Hosting/Infrastructure**: Netlify

### Architecture Considerations

- **Repository Structure**: Monorepo using Turborepo.
- **Service Architecture**: Jamstack with serverless functions and third-party APIs.
- **Integration Requirements**: Sanity.io, Netlify Forms, Make.com, EmailOctopus, Google Analytics.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- The project relies on the free or standard tiers of several SaaS products (Netlify, Sanity, Make.com), and is subject to their limitations.

### Key Assumptions

- The headless architecture will provide the required performance and scalability.
- The chosen SaaS platforms will remain available and their APIs will be stable.

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Dependency Risk**: The project is heavily dependent on external services. An outage or significant change in any of these services could impact the website.
- **Integration Risk**: Changes in the APIs of integrated services could require development work to update the website.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1.  Finalize and approve the Project Brief.
2.  Create the detailed Frontend Architecture document.
3.  Begin setting up the monorepo structure and initial project scaffolding.
