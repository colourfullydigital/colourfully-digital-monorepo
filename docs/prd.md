### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals

- To modernize the visual design of the website, making it more appealing and professional.
- To improve user engagement by creating a more intuitive and seamless user experience.
- To increase conversion rates for key actions like volunteer applications and newsletter subscriptions.

#### Background Context

While the current architecture is sound, the user interface and user experience can be significantly improved to better serve the foundation's mission and audience. A full UX/UI overhaul will ensure the website is not only functional but also engaging, accessible, and reflective of the foundation's brand and values. This will help attract and retain users, volunteers, and donors.

## Requirements

### Functional

- FR1: The system will provide a headless architecture for the Colourfully Digital Foundation website.
- FR2: The system will use Sanity.io as a headless CMS for all content.
- FR3: The system will use a statically-generated frontend built with Astro and interactive React components.
- FR4: The system will use Netlify Forms with Make.com workflows for dynamic operations like form submissions and backend automation.

### Non Functional

- NFR1: The system will be flexible, scalable, and maintainable.
- NFR2: The system will be managed within a single monorepo to facilitate code sharing and streamlined development.
- NFR3: The new design will be fully responsive and accessible, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

### Compatibility Requirements

- CR1: The system will be compatible with the Sanity.io API.
- CR2: The system will be compatible with the Netlify Forms API.
- CR3: The system will be compatible with the Make.com API.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript
**Frameworks**: Astro 5.9, React 19.0.0
**Database**: Sanity.io
**Infrastructure**: Netlify
**External Dependencies**: EmailOctopus, Make.com, Google Analytics 4

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: The system will use the Sanity.io API for all database interactions.
**API Integration Strategy**: The system will use the Netlify Forms API and the Make.com API for all API interactions.
**Frontend Integration Strategy**: The system will use Astro and React for all frontend interactions.
**Testing Integration Strategy**: The system will use a combination of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure that the system is working as expected.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: The system will use a monorepo structure with `apps` and `packages` directories.
**Naming Conventions**: The system will use the naming conventions outlined in the architecture document.
**Coding Standards**: The system will use the coding standards outlined in the architecture document.
**Documentation Standards**: The system will use the documentation standards outlined in the architecture document.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: The system will use the build process outlined in the architecture document.
**Deployment Strategy**: The system will use the deployment strategy outlined in the architecture document.
**Monitoring and Logging**: The system will use the monitoring and logging strategy outlined in the architecture document.
**Configuration Management**: The system will use the configuration management strategy outlined in the architecture document.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: The system is dependent on a number of external services. If any of these services are unavailable, the system will not be able to function properly.
**Integration Risks**: The system is dependent on a number of external services. If any of these services change their API, the system will need to be updated.
**Deployment Risks**: The system is dependent on a number of external services. If any of these services are unavailable, the system will not be able to be deployed.
**Mitigation Strategies**: The system will use a combination of monitoring and logging to ensure that any problems with the system are identified and addressed in a timely manner.

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single Epic

## Epic 1: UI/UX Overhaul

**Epic Goal**: To redesign and implement a new user interface and experience for the Colourfully Digital Foundation website that is modern, engaging, and user-friendly, based on the provided Design Brief and Design System.

### Story 1.1: Implement Design System in Tailwind CSS

As a developer,
I want the provided design system to be configured in Tailwind CSS,
so that I can use the defined tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) in the project.

- 2: Base styles are configured to apply the primary font and text colors.

#### Integration Verification

- IV1: The Tailwind IntelliSense plugin in VS Code correctly suggests the custom design tokens.

### Story 1.2: Redesign and Implement the Homepage

As a user,
I want a visually engaging and easy-to-navigate homepage,
so that I can quickly understand the foundation's mission and find the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- 1: The homepage is redesigned according to the new UI/UX mockups.
- 2: All components on the homepage use the new design system.
- 3: The homepage is fully responsive and accessible.

#### Integration Verification

- IV1: All links and forms on the homepage function as expected.

### Story 1.3: Redesign and Implement Program Display Pages

- 2: The new design effectively showcases program details, schedules, and registration information.
- 3: The pages are responsive and accessible.

#### Integration Verification

- IV1: Links to program registration (e.g., Eventbrite) are correct and functional.

### Story 1.4: Redesign and Implement Volunteer Application Form

As a potential volunteer,
I want a simple and intuitive application form,
so that I can easily apply to become a volunteer without frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria
