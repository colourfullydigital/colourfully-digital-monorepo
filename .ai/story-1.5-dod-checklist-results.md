## Final Confirmation

**Summary of Accomplishments:**
- Successfully implemented comprehensive bilingual support for the website
- Created custom i18n solution that is maintainable and follows TypeScript best practices
- Language switcher with intelligent URL translation between English and French routes
- Enhanced Sanity.io integration with language filtering capabilities
- All components properly localized with fallback support
- Build process generates correct static routes for both languages

**Items Marked as Not Done:** None - all applicable items completed successfully.

**Technical Debt/Follow-up Work:**
- Consider implementing client-side language detection for future enhancement
- May want to add more comprehensive translation content as site grows
- Future stories may benefit from expanding translation utilities

**Challenges and Learnings:**
- astro-i18next package had build compatibility issues, leading to custom solution
- Custom TypeScript-based translation system proved more maintainable and performant
- Static site generation works well with language-specific routing

- [x] I, the Developer Agent, confirm that all applicable items above have been addressed.

**FINAL VERDICT: Story 1.5 is Ready for Review**
